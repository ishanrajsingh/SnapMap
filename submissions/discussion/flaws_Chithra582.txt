Issue:

1. Map screen becomes slow when many photo markers load together due to lack of clustering and lazy loading.
2. App has no offline handling or network error feedback, causing silent failures during uploads.
3. Photo upload allows missing metadata (caption/tags), reducing event and content quality.
4. Upload progress UI is minimal and does not show percentage or retry options.
5. Gallery screens load all images at once, leading to performance issues (no pagination).
6. Backend APIs lack rate limiting, making the system vulnerable to spam uploads.
7. API responses are inconsistent across endpoints, complicating frontend handling.
8. No centralized error logging or monitoring is implemented on the backend.
9. Map location accuracy is not validated, causing incorrect photo placement.
10. Missing core features like photo filtering, likes/comments, and search reduce user engagement; these can be added via new routes, models, and UI screens.


Solution for the issue:

1. When many photos are present on the map, it feels slightly slow because all markers load at once; using clustering or lazy loading could improve performance.
2. The app does not clearly handle poor internet situations, so adding basic offline or retry feedback would improve user experience.
3. Photo uploads currently work without much validation; asking users for optional captions or tags could make content more meaningful.
4. Upload feedback is minimal, and showing upload progress or success/failure messages would make the process clearer.
5. Image galleries load all content together, which could be improved by adding pagination or infinite scrolling.
6. Backend APIs do not seem to have rate limiting, which could be added to prevent excessive or spam uploads.
7. Some API responses vary in structure; using a consistent response format would make frontend handling easier.
8. There is no visible centralized error logging on the backend, which could help in debugging and monitoring.
9. Location accuracy is not explicitly handled, which might sometimes lead to incorrect photo placement on the map.
10. Features like filtering photos, likes/comments, or search could improve engagement and can be added incrementally using new routes, models, and UI screens.
