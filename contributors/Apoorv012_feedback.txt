Working on this repo was a blast. Learnt a lot of new technologies, specially the clerk... Like authentication is so easy that way. Collaborating with a lot of great coders was fun.

Usually we just keep on thinking, on how snapchat was made, how insta was made. Here, we made something similar to that, breaking that mind block.

Abdul... great maintainer... great friend... could not have asked for a better person to ask your doubts regarding the issues, or opencode.
