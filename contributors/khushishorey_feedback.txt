The best repo and an absolutely amazing repo handler. I’m very sure everyone learned so much from 
this, and honestly, it was a fun experience too. The issues were great, and watching different 
people brainstorm solutions on the Discord channel was truly inspiring and motivating.

Now coming to the maintainer—no words for this guy. An absolute beast when it comes to his work 
(especially ye opencode wala). The way you managed all of this along with your other commitments…
it’s really not everyone’s cup of tea. HATS OFF, MAN!!!

And on a more personal note— I know how much of yourself you put into this..seeing you do this every
single day without getting bored was crazy to watch. Although it didn’t inspire me to the level ki
main bhi utni hi shiddat se lag jaaun (agar lag jaati toh shayad aaj main bhi top 10 mein hoti aur
free me merch mil jaati 😭). Khair, OpenCode khatam ho gaya, but everyone now has their own share
of memories—and that’s the best part.

Thank you so much for handling both my silly doubts and mood swings...Well Done, Abdul
Lots of Love to u and ur repo ♡♡♡♡♡♡
